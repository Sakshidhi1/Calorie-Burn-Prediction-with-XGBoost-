ðŸ”¥ Calorie Burn Prediction (Kaggle)
This project predicts calories burned during exercise using physiological features like age, gender, heart rate, weight, and body temperature. Built for a Kaggle regression competition.

ðŸ§  Key Highlights

Used XGBoost Regressor with RandomizedSearchCV for tuning.

Engineered features: BMI, Workout Intensity, Temp-HR Ratio, Age Groups.

Applied StandardScaler and log1p transformation for better accuracy.

Achieved low RMSLE with good generalization on test data.


ðŸ§° Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib
